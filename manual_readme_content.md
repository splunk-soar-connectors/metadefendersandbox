# MetaDefender Sandbox App

MetaDefender Sandbox (previously known as OPSWAT Filescan Sandbox) is a unique adaptive threat analysis technology, enabling zero-day malware detection and comprehensive Indicator of Compromise (IOC) extraction.

## What does this App do?

This app includes the MetaDefender Sandbox basic integration that does the following:

**Detonate file**  
Retrieve detonation analysis results for file

**Detonate URL**  
Retrieve detonation analysis results for URL

**Search report**  
Search for scan reports on MetaDefender Sandbox using parameters specified in the 'query' field.

**File reputation**  
Get the fast reputation for one given hash (returns the last 10 MetaDefender Sandbox reports)

**IP/Domain/URL reputation**  
Get the fast reputation for one given IOC. E.g.: IP, Domain or URL (returns the last 10 MetaDefender Sandbox reports)

This app requires a correctly set up MetaDefender Sandbox API key to use.

## Port Information

The app uses HTTPS protocol if it uses the MetaDefender Sandbox community server (default). You can deviate from this if you want to use your own, on-prem MetaDefender Sandbox server. Below are
the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.

|         Service Name | Transport Protocol | Port |
|----------------------|--------------------|------|
|         https        | tcp                | 443  |
